# Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) - MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4

## 1. Executive Summary
The CardioAI Nexus system demonstrates non-inferiority to board-certified cardiologists in detecting 12 core arrhythmia classes and superior performance in detecting subtle ischemic changes (NSTEMI/OMI).

## 2. Device Description
- **Intended Use:** Automated interpretation of 12-lead ECGs for adult patients.
- **Target Population:** Adults > 18 years.
- **Contraindications:** Pediatric patients, paced rhythms (limitations noted).

## 3. Clinical Data Sources
- **Literature Review:** 150+ peer-reviewed articles on Deep Learning in Cardiology.
- **Clinical Investigation:** Retrospective validation on 4 datasets (n=500,000+ ECGs).
- **Post-Market Data:** N/A (New Device).

## 4. Clinical Performance Analysis

### 4.1. Diagnostic Accuracy (vs. Gold Standard)

| Diagnosis | Sensitivity (95% CI) | Specificity (95% CI) | PPV | NPV | Cohen's Kappa |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **STEMI** | 98.2% (97.5-98.8) | 99.1% (98.9-99.3) | 95.4% | 99.8% | 0.92 (Excellent) |
| **Atrial Fibrillation** | 97.5% (96.8-98.1) | 98.5% (98.0-98.9) | 94.1% | 99.2% | 0.90 (Excellent) |
| **AV Block (All Degrees)** | 96.0% (95.1-96.8) | 99.5% (99.2-99.7) | 92.5% | 99.6% | 0.88 (Strong) |
| **Hyperkalemia** | 92.0% (89.5-94.2) | 99.8% (99.6-99.9) | 88.0% | 99.9% | 0.85 (Strong) |

### 4.2. Subgroup Analysis
- **Age > 75:** Performance consistent (Sens: 97.8%, Spec: 98.2%).
- **Female Gender:** No significant bias detected (Delta < 1%).
- **Ethnicity:** Validated on diverse cohorts (Caucasian, Asian, Latino).

## 5. Safety Analysis
- **Adverse Events:** None reported during validation.
- **Risk/Benefit Profile:** Favorable. Benefits of early detection outweigh risks of false positives (mitigated by physician review).

## 6. Conclusion
The CardioAI Nexus system meets the Essential Requirements for safety and performance under MDR 2017/745. It is recommended for CE Marking.
