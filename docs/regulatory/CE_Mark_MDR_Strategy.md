# CE Mark (MDR 2017/745) Strategy
**Device Name:** CardioAI Nexus
**Classification:** Class IIa (Rule 11 - Software intended to provide information which is used to take decisions with diagnosis or therapeutic purposes)
**Conformity Assessment Route:** Annex IX (Quality Management System and Assessment of Technical Documentation)

## 1. General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR)
Compliance with Annex I of the MDR is mandatory. Key requirements for AI software:
*   **Performance:** Software must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer (Sensitivity/Specificity).
*   **Repeatability/Reliability:** The AI must provide consistent results given the same input.
*   **IT Environment:** Specify hardware/software requirements (e.g., modern web browser, internet connection).
*   **Cybersecurity:** Implement state-of-the-art security measures (ISO 80001 / MDCG 2019-16).

## 2. Quality Management System (ISO 13485:2016)
A certified QMS is required.
*   **Document Control:** Strict versioning of code, models, and documentation.
*   **Risk Management (ISO 14971:2019):** Continuous risk management throughout the lifecycle.
*   **Software Lifecycle (IEC 62304:2015):** Software safety class B or C (depending on risk of misdiagnosis).

## 3. Clinical Evaluation (MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4 & MDCG 2020-1)
*   **Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP):** Define the scope, intended purpose, and methodology.
*   **Literature Route:** May not be sufficient for novel AI.
*   **Clinical Investigation:** Likely required to demonstrate performance on European populations.
*   **Clinical Evaluation Report (CER):** Synthesize all clinical data demonstrating conformity with GSPRs.

## 4. Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) & PMCF
*   **PMS Plan:** Proactive collection of real-world performance data.
*   **Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF):** Continuous evaluation of the AI model's accuracy in clinical practice to detect drift or bias.
*   **Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR):** Required annually for Class IIa.

## 5. Technical Documentation (Annex II & III)
*   Device description and specification.
*   Information supplied by the manufacturer (Labeling, IFU).
*   Design and manufacturing information (Architecture, AI training data details, validation).
*   GSPR checklist.
*   Benefit-risk analysis.
*   Pre-clinical and clinical data.

## 6. AI-Specific Considerations (AI Act Alignment)
While the EU AI Act is evolving, medical devices are high-risk AI systems.
*   **Data Governance:** Training, validation, and testing datasets must be relevant, representative, and free of errors/bias.
*   **Transparency:** Users must understand how the AI works (Explainability/XAI features).
*   **Human Oversight:** The system must be designed to allow human oversight (e.g., "Physician Overread Required").
*   **Accuracy & Robustness:** Resilient to errors, faults, or inconsistencies.

---
**Action Plan:**
1.  Establish ISO 13485 QMS.
2.  Engage a Notified Body (e.g., BSI, TÜV SÜD).
3.  Compile Technical Documentation.
4.  Conduct Clinical Investigation (if required).
5.  Notified Body Audit (Stage 1 & 2).
6.  CE Marking and Declaration of Conformity.
